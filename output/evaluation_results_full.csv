Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**Understanding CVID**

CVID is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a deficiency in the production of mature B cells, which are essential for humoral immunity. This deficiency leads to a weakened immune system, making individuals susceptible to recurrent infections, particularly those caused by bacteria and viruses.

**Genes Involved in B Cell Development and Function**

Several genes are involved in the development and function of B cells. Mutations in these genes can disrupt the normal processes of B cell maturation and function, leading to CVID.

* **Fibrin cross-linking** is the process where Factor XIII links together the fibrin strands, forming a strong and stable clot.
* **Without Factor XIII**, the fibrin mesh remains weak and fragile, leading to:
    * **Increased bleeding:**  The clot is less stable and prone to rupture, leading to excessive bleeding.

* **Cell proliferation and differentiation:** They control the growth and specialization of cells, influencing processes like stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration.
* **Extracellular matrix (ECM) production:** They regulate the synthesis and organization of ECM components, influencing tissue structure and strength.
* **Cell signaling:** They participate in complex signaling networks, influencing cell behavior and interactions.

**Dietary Restrictions:**

* **Reduce Copper Intake:** The primary goal is to limit copper absorption and prevent its buildup in the body.

    * **Certain fruits:** Some fruits, like grapes and strawberries, can have higher copper content.

**Foods to Avoid",False,5.0,"Reasoning:

Step 2:  The Context provides the following information:
    * Wilson disease is a genetic disease that prevents the body from removing extra copper.
    * The liver filters extra copper and releases it into bile. In Wilson disease, the liver does not filter copper correctly and copper builds up in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs.
    * People with Wilson disease may have liver-related signs and symptoms, central nervous system-related signs and symptoms, mental health-related signs and symptoms, and other signs and symptoms.
    * A health care provider will treat Wilson disease with a lifelong effort to reduce and control the amount of copper in the body. Treatment may include medications, changes in eating, diet, and nutrition, a liver transplant.
    * People with Wilson disease should reduce their dietary copper intake by avoiding foods that are high in copper, such as:
        * Organ meats
        * Shellfish
        * Chocolate
        * Nuts and seeds
